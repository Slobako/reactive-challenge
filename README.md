Exploring use of ReactiveJSON framework for network requests

Using Xcode 8 and Swift 3.0, write a networked application which can fetch resources from at least 3 endpoints shown on JSON Placeholder [1]. The application MUST use this networking library [2] to fetch the resources. The results should be displayed in either a table view or collection, and cells should be selectable; however, the style and format of displaying results is up to the applicant.

Note:
Project has been created in Xcode 9 with Swift 4.0. I assume that might have been the reason for difficulties importing the ReactiveJSON framework. It builds successfully despite constantly displaying errors "use of undeclared type xxxxx" or "type yyyyy has no member request" etc.
